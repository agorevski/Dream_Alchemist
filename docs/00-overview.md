## Development Workflow

### Iterative Build Process
1. Implement data models and core services
2. Build and test each system independently
3. Integrate systems incrementally
4. Test on emulator after each integration
5. Optimize and refine
6. Test on physical devices
7. Deploy to Google Play beta track

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests:** All service logic and calculations
- **Integration Tests:** System interactions
- **UI Tests:** Critical user flows
- **Device Tests:** Multiple manufacturers and API levels
- **Performance Tests:** Memory, battery, frame rate

## Key Milestones

| Milestone | Deliverable | Target Week |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| M1 | Project setup complete, data models implemented | Week 2 |
| M2 | Economy system functional, prices simulating | Week 4 |
| M3 | Trading and crafting working, AI integration live | Week 7 |
| M4 | Travel and progression systems complete | Week 9 |
| M5 | Events system and story triggers functional | Week 11 |
| M6 | All UI screens implemented with animations | Week 14 |
| M7 | Monetization integrated, audio added | Week 16 |
| M8 | Testing complete, ready for deployment | Week 18 |

## Critical Success Factors

### Technical
- Efficient market simulation (must handle 50+ ingredients × 5 cities)
- Smooth SkiaSharp rendering (60fps target)
- Fast save/load (under 500ms)
- Responsive UI on low-end devices (API 21+)

### Gameplay
- Engaging economic simulation with meaningful choices
- Satisfying synthesis mechanics with discovery moments
- Balanced progression curve
- Compelling narrative hooks

### Business
- Ethical monetization that doesn't break gameplay
- Clear Google Play compliance
- Positive user retention metrics

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------------------|
| AI API costs too high | Implement caching, batch requests, limit generations |
| Performance issues on old devices | Profiling from start, optimization passes, settings toggles |
| Market simulation too complex | Prototype early, simplify formula if needed |
| Scope creep | Strict phase boundaries, MVP mindset |
| Save corruption | Versioned saves, automatic backups, cloud sync |
